# Erdős Institute Data Science Boot Camp
## Spring 2024 Edition

This repository contains the materials for the Spring 2024 edition of the Erdős Institute's Data Science Boot Camp programming, https://www.erdosinstitute.org/programs/spring-2023/data-science-boot-camp. To learn more about the boot camp visit that website. Below we will provide a breakdown of the contents of this repository, see the README file in each folder for a more detailed description.

## data

The data folder contains various data files used throughout the repository's notebooks.

## lectures

This folder contains the lecture jupyter notebooks for the boot camp. Each lecture will have a blank version of the notebook as well as a "complete" version of the notebook. The complete notebooks match the notebooks seen in the pre-recorded lecture videos on the boot camp's website. The blank versions are for you to complete on your own. Feel free to practice or take notes with these versions of the notebooks. 

Notebooks that were covered in a live lecture will also have a lecture version (uploaded shortly after the lecture is completed), this version of the notebook will contain all of the notes from the live lecture.

## problem-sessions

This folder contains the jupyter notebooks used in our problem solving sessions. You can also find "prep" notebooks in this folder. Prep notebooks are for those participants wishing to have additional practice prior to the correspong problem solving session. Prep notebooks are optional.

## practice-problems

This folder contains jupyter notebooks that hold problems you can work on for practice. Each notebook will have an accompanying solution notebook. <i>Note</i>, these notebooks are not mandatory, they just exist as a way for you to test yourself on the material covered in lecture.
