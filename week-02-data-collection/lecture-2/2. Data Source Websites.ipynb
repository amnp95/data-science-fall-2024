    "- Point you in the direction of some online sources of data,\n",
    "- Introduce the concept of a data repository,\n",
    "- Demonstrate a few popular data repositories,\n",

    "In order to complete a data science project you need data. There are a number of excellent online data sources that you can tap into for portfolio projects, including your Erd&#337;s Institute Data Science Boot Camp project. While there are a wide array of online data sources, two of the most popular are:\n",
    "1. Data repositories, and\n",
    "2. Data competition sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "We will call a <i>data repository</i> any website where data sets are deposited. These can exist for many reasons for example:\n",
    "- Housing data associated with published academic research,\n",
    "- Holding data that was used by a news organization or\n",
    "- Holding benchmark data sets that are used to compare algorithmic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's review a couple different kinds and give some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "These repositories house data affiliated with academic research papers. They exist for both the purpose of replication and to spur additional research. Here are some examples:\n",
    "- The UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, <a href=\"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php\">https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php</a>, (<i>a very popular repository</i>),\n",
    "- A repository of COVID-19 Tweets, <a href=\"https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19273/\">https://publichealth.jmir.org/2020/2/e19273/</a>,\n",
    "- The Mendeley Data repository site, <a href=\"https://data.mendeley.com/\">https://data.mendeley.com/</a> and\n",
    "- The Harvard Dataverse, <a href=\"https://dataverse.harvard.edu/\">https://dataverse.harvard.edu/</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub repositories\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many GitHub repositories whose sole purpose is data storage. News organizations and data-based blogs/websites often have repositories that store the data sets accompanying their stories/posts. For example:\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/\">FiveThirtyEight</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/\">https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/</a>,\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/\">The New York Times</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/nytimes\">https://github.com/nytimes</a> and\n",
    "- <a href=\"https://pudding.cool/\">Pudding.cool</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/the-pudding/data\">https://github.com/the-pudding/data</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also repositories maintained by individual users not affiliated with any larger organization. These may be harder to find, but if you have a data set in mind it can be a good idea to do a web search for an existing GitHub repository. This could save you a lot of time and work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An example\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's demonstrate how you can use a repository to access data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a data set from the FiveThirtyEight repository. Let's download the `candy-data.csv` from the folder associated with this post, <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/\">https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First go to the link associated with the data file, <a href=\"https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv\">https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv</a>.\n",
    "2. Then click on the `Raw` button above the data table demonstrated on the page.\n",
    "3. Using your web browser, save the file as `candy-data.csv` within the `Data Collection` folder of this repository.\n",
    "4. Run the code chunks below."

Many repositories will have guidelines on how you are allowed to use their data set.\n",
